# hydroblimp
Making a hydrogen generator and a remote control mini blimp.

## Hydrogen generator;
Use electrolysis as our generation method. Further details in `/hydro`.

- 3d printed mount (Need to use ABS not PLA)
- Some guesses at expected yield.

## Fluidics;
Need a jig to store the HHO gas, a good method would be an inverted jar
approach, but also need a one way valve and some method to pressurise the
balloon for the blimp:

- Piping diagram.
- Pump setup.

## Blimp;
First idea is a single motor with two fins being actuated by servo's.
Mostly for simplicity, but might be good from a weight reduction approach.

- PCB.
- Air frame.
- Radio link/controller of some kind.
- Some guesses at buoyancy and mylar balloon shape.
