## Charging a LiPo with a desktop PSU

With a desktop PSU, look up the LiPo in question. This project is designed for a
7.4V 1S. Then check the full charge voltage and set the PSU to this. Then check
the specified mA operating current and set the PSU to about 1/4 this value.

To increase charging speed, you can increase the current draw on the PSU, but
be careful as you now need to monitor the heat produced.
