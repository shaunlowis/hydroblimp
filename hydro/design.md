# Overview
For now will just use Helium as lifting gas, hydrogen generation postponed.

## Anodes/Cathodes
Was originally going to use AA battery cores for anodes and cathodes,
but don't want to add all of the chemical paste to the solution.

Titanium plates are most recommended as they won't produce toxic
salts from the electrolysis.

Design in onshape [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/11e8b4afca43f1b58dd3ea7a/w/9a1579be23d9b421699b7865/e/278ab0829adb92fd8254bba1?renderMode=0&uiState=66765533c651a55562f518a5).

The first revision is just for a small jar, to check the proof of concept.

Procurement through PCB Way is really expensive, will get sheets and 
machine the plates myself.

## Solution
Distilled water and NaOH salt will be used for the solution.
This is also known as caustic soda and is readily available.


## Structure/misc components
Need to use ABS as the print filament for 3D printed parts, as the
NaOH solution will weaken/dissolve PLA.
